# Salary_Prediction_Model
To build a salary prediction model using logistic regression, we can follow these steps:

1.Collect a dataset of hiring and other relevant features, such as 
experience	test_score(out of 10)	interview_score(out of 10)	salary($)

2.Clean and prepare the data. This may involve removing outliers, handling missing values, and converting categorical features to numerical features.

3.Split the data into training and testing sets. We will use the training set to train the model and the testing set to evaluate the model's performance.

4.Create a Multilinear regression model. We can use the LinearRegression class from the scikit-learn library.

5.Train the  Multilinear regression model on the training data. We can use the fit() method to train the model.

6.Use the linear regression model to predict salaries for new data points. We can use the predict() method to predict salaries for new data points.
